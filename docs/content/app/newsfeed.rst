    *Our example article in the newsline.*

In the "News" tab you can see what we'd like to call "newsline":
A timeline of news, so to say, where you can see all of the articles published by the student groups across all countries.

The following information will be displayed with an article:

* Title
* Author's name
* Author's short description
* Date when the article was last modified (or created, if it hasn't been modified)

If any information named above needs to be changed, refer to the interface_ doc.
If you are not able to manipulate the information through the interface, contact your advisor or let him contact us on your behalf.
