The information tab
===================

    *Infos are displayed in the infos tab.*

Upon taking a look at the info tab, users can see *static* information covering
different topics all around the project. One topic is displayed as one "block".
Example info blocks include the following topics:

* SmartPlastic app
* Erasmus+
* The participating schools
* Waste Disposal Systems

You can add information blocks inside the interface.
These infos will always be visible, although they will get grouped if there are too many.
We plan to add a feature to filter for a specific name, topic or content so that you can
find specific information more easily.
