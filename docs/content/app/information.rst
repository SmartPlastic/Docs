The information tab
===================

Upon taking a look at the info tab, users can see *static* information covering
different topics all around the project. One topic is displayed as one "block".
Example info blocks include the following topics:

* SmartPlastic app
* Erasmus+
* The participating schools
* Waste Disposal Systems

You can add information blocks inside the interface. If you want to edit an
info block, contact a teacher (or someone else with a higher security level)
and ask them to do so. Only manager (teacher) are able to delete info blocks.
