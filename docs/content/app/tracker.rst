    *Track your "SmartPlastic Score"*

In this menu you can track your so called "SmartPlastic Score": Estimating a value for the plastic you
threw away, categorizing it as easy as in three sizes: Small, Medium and Large, you can keep track of
your plastic usage and strive to reduce the amount continuously. As soon as multiple scores across
different countries have added up, we will publish some interesting statistics, strategies to reduce
ones plastic usage and some experience reports.
