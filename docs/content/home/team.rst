The team
========

Florian & Thomas
----------------

We, Florian Hauser and Thomas Lenz, started SmartPlastic in August 2018.
We have been asked to create the SmartPlastic app for the Erasmus project by
one of our teachers and started thinking about it. In Germany, you can do a
special scientific work called *BLL* (which roughly translates to
*Special-Study-Accomplishment*) and thus earn points for your graduation.
We decided to create the app and make it the subject of this scientific work we
need to turn in before July 2019.

Before starting this project, we have been coding for fun using different
languages, but haven't heard of ``reStructuredText``, haven't have any
experience dealing with server hosting nor dived into ``Python`` this deeply.
As this app is literally *tons of work*, we are happy for every helping hand we
can reach out to, and as you can see with us as an example, it doesn't even take
any precognitions. Writing or translating documentation doesn't require any
coding experience at all (besides rest markup, but that's easy, duh), and we
also need people for ``HTML`` and ``CSS`` styling the WebApp, too.

We are happy that we are dealing with a topic with such a great importance.
Environmental protection is important to us, and this is how we thought of
"We are not just into this, we are up for the cause." as our project's caption.
We are looking forward to working together with great companies like the
`WWF <https://wwf.org>`__ or `Parley <https://parley.tv>`__ during the project.
