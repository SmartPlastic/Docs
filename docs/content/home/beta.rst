Currently, we provide a beta app for both the Android and iOS powered
mobile phones. If you are prompted for log in credentials, use ``test`` as
the username and ``Erasmus+`` as the password.
To install the beta, follow the steps below:

Android beta
************

#. Make sure your Android version is ``5.0`` or higher.
   You can find your version number in your phone's settings.
#. Follow `this link <https://play.google.com/apps/testing/eu.smartplastic.smartplastic>`__ on your mobile to get to the beta entrance website. On this
   website, press the button to enter beta (you may need to authenticate with
   your Google account)
#. After the successfull entry, you'll be able to find the app in your usual
   Play Store by searching for "SmartPlastic". Download it, and it should appear
   on your home screen or the apps list. You are now able to start the app.


iOS beta
********

#. Make sure your iOS version is ``9.0`` or higher. You can find your version
   number in your phone's settings: ``Settings > General > About > Version``.
#. Send an E-Mail to thomas.lenz@hauserlenz.com. Please provide (1) your Apple-ID
   and (2) your full name.
#. You will be added to the beta tester group and receive an email that should
   look somewhat similar to the one on the right.
#. Click the link inside the email adress. You will be redirected to a page
   that offers you to enter the beta upon installing the App ``Testflight``.
#. Download ``Testflight`` from your iPhone's App Store and click the link in
   email again if the SmartPlastic beta doesn't show up in the app.
#. Inside ``Testflight``, download SmartPlastic. It should appear on your homescreen
   and feature a red dot left of the name to signal that it's a beta
   application. Now you can click on the app and enjoy.

Even though the way above is the preffered way, should you run into any issues, try accessing `this link <https://testflight.apple.com/join/6jowO>`__ on your mobile to get to the Testflight registration.
After that, follow the above steps (starting with step 4) to finish installing the beta.
