Joint Staff Training
====================

November 20, 2018, we held our joint staff training in Dierdorf where the teachers of the Erasmus project came together to discuss the project.
Florian and Thomas held a presentation on the state of the app, where they explained the following:

* Main parts of the app to focus on
* How to use the interface
* How to upload and manage content
* How to work together collaboratively
and more...
