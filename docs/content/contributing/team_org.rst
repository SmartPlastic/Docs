Team organization
=================

Our team features an imperial structure that makes clear who is able to do what
and points out why. Currently, our hierarchy is organized as follows. You can
check what group a developer is assigned to in the LINK/HOME TEAMS  doc.

+--------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+

   When one wants to work on the project freely, they can feel free to fork the repo at any time.

.. Note:: *: Some senior developers may get access to the App Store Connect
   based on their impact on the project if needed.

.. Hint:: The head developers decide which role is assigned to whom. We will
   not give roes based on what others say but purely on our own impression.
