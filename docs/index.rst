Welcome to SmartPlastic's documentation
=======================================

This handbook has been *carefully crafted and bottled* by our developer
team. It should provide any information needed to work with the app, it's
interface, and point out more relevant facts.

Furthermore, this documentation is the starting point of everybody who wants
to take an active (coding) part in the project to dive in.

If you got any questions going beyond what is mentioned in the documentation,
feel free to say hi to us via email (find them on the
`interface's website <http://interface.smartplastic.eu>`__).

Greetings from Germany!
