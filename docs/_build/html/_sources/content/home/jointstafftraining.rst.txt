**Dierdorf, Germany, November 20.**
We held our joint staff training in Dierdorf, where the teachers of the Erasmus+
project came together to discuss the launch.
After Jan-Micha Kroll, a former student of the MBG who created Sdui_,
an awesome app making school-student communication way easier,
Florian and Thomas held a presentation on the state of the app,
where they explained the following:

* Main parts of the app to focus on
* How to use the interface
* How to upload and manage content
* How to work together collaboratively
* and more...

Below, you'll find some further instructions on how to connect your student
with us, download the beta app, or download the presentation's files.
